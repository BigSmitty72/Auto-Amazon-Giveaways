# Auto-Amazon-Giveaways
[UPDATE] Base no requirement giveaways are implemented for first page.  Need to include page iteration next. Should have more time to work on this now that I am not in class 04/29.

Implementation for this project is currently a work-in-progress.  Issues are expected.

## Install
[Python 3.6.x](https://www.python.org/downloads/) must be installed.

After Python is installed, open `command-prompt` and use `pip` to install dependencies from project folder:

 - `pip install -r requirements.txt`

Assuming `git` is installed on the local machine:

 - Open `command-prompt` and `cd` to a location/folder to save the project.
 - Perform `git clone https://github.com/zdrouse/Auto-Amazon-Giveaways`.

## Run
 - `python give_it_away_now.py` or `python3 give_it_away_now.py`

## Profit
