# Auto-Amazon-Giveaways
[UPDATE] Currently re-designing this project to use pyppeteer instead of selenium.
This requires Python 3 now.  Giveaway entries are not working yet. 04/18.

Implementation for this project is currently a work-in-progress.  Issues are expected.

## Install
[Python 3.6.X](https://www.python.org/downloads/) must be installed.

After Python is installed, open `command-prompt` and use `pip` to install dependencies:

 - `pip install pyppeteer`

Assuming `git` is installed on the local machine:

 - Open `command-prompt` and `cd` to a location/folder to save the project.
 - Perform `git clone https://github.com/zdrouse/Auto-Amazon-Giveaways`.

## Run
 - `python giveaway.py`

## Profit
